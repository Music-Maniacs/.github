# Overview

Welcome to *Music Maniacs*, an open-source online community for music lovers.

This project began as a college thesis project and it's our intention to continue with our original mission and rebuild it from the ground up.

## Original app

From our thesis project: "..to provide a platform that serves as the meeting point by excellence, for users who want to explore, comment on, discuss, rate, and discover musical events, centralizing information about events, artists, venues, and event producer organizations."

### Core original functionalities

With a public database mantained by the community, the main feature of the app are:
- Event Discovery: Easily find upcoming music events tailored to your interests.
- Community Engagement: Share your thoughts, write reviews, and discuss events with fellow music lovers.
- Artist, EventProducers and Venue Profiles: Explore detailed profiles of artists, venues, and production companies.
- Follow & Notify: Stay updated with real-time notifications for your favorite artists, venues, and events.
- Trust Levels: Build your reputation and unlock new features as you actively engage with the platform.
- Moderation Tools: Contribute to a safe and respectful community environment with content reporting and moderation features.

## The glorious evolution

The original app was mainly centered in music events, now, our idea is to take it to the next level. Combining [music brainz's](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server) public database, and the all mighty open source discussion platform [discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse), we aim to create the place every music maniac has only dare to dream of.

### Mission

The go-to platform for *discussing* everything about music.

### Vision

The ultimate platform for music exploration and discovery.
