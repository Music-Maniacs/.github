# Overview

Welcome to *Music Maniacs*, an open-source online community for music lovers.

This project began as a college thesis project and it's our intention to continue with our original mission and build it again from the ground up.

## Original app

From our thesis project: "The objective is to provide a platform that serves as the meeting point by excelense, for users who want to view, comment on, discuss, rate, and/or discover musical events and centralize information about events, artists, venues, and event producer organizations."

Check our original docs [here](/thesis/README.md)

### Mission
Our mission is to provide a collaborative and inclusive platform where users worldwide can engage with live music events by exploring, reviewing, and sharing their passion for music.

### Vision
We aim to become the ultimate platform for music lovers, fostering a vibrant online community that bridges audiences, artists, and event organizers, while celebrating the power of music to bring people together.

### Core Functionalities

With a public database mantained by the community, the main feature of the app are:
- Event Discovery: Easily find upcoming music events tailored to your interests.
- Community Engagement: Share your thoughts, write reviews, and discuss events with fellow music lovers.
- Artist, EventProducers and Venue Profiles: Explore detailed profiles of artists, venues, and production companies.
- Follow & Notify: Stay updated with real-time notifications for your favorite artists, venues, and events.
- Trust Levels: Build your reputation and unlock new features as you actively engage with the platform.
- Moderation Tools: Contribute to a safe and respectful community environment with content reporting and moderation features.

## The glorious evolution

The original app was mainly centered in music events, now, our idea is to take it to the next level. Combining [music brainz's](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server) public database, and the all mighty open source discussion platform [discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse), we aim to create the place every music maniac has only dare to dream of.


### Mission

The go-to platform for *discussing* everything about music.

### Vision

The ultimate platform for music exploration and discovery.
